RSH::ConfigFile version 1.0.x
=============================

RSH::ConfigFile is a configuration file that uses standard text
'key = value' lines, where value can be a string, an array, or
a hash.  In some ways, it is similar to Java properties files.
It's primary goal is to make the source config file extremely
easy to edit, make the entries and syntax largely self-documenting,
and to make it very hard to screw up.

The work for this module largely came from an aborted attempt to
write a hosting management package.  It was written a while back,
but I keep finding portions of it very useful.  I particularly 
find the LockFile implementation useful at random times.
So I thought it was high time to just shove it out there for others 
to use, poke at, or deride.
  
Enjoy!
